# Seme Framework

> A Lightweight PHP MVC Framework for your web-based application.

## Overview

Seme Framework is a comprehensive PHP solution designed to simplify the development process for building medium-scale web applications. With its lightweight codebase and traditional method approach, Seme Framework allows developers to focus on creating robust applications without the overhead of starting from scratch.

The framework's design provides a great balance between ease of use and flexibility, making it suitable for both new programmers who want to build their first project and veteran developers looking for a reliable foundation. One of its key advantages is the minimal impact it has on development speed and resources during the application's development phase until production time.

## Key Features

The Seme Framework is built on PHP and designed for ease of use. Here are some reasons why it's a great choice for your next project:

- **Lightweight and Flexible**: The Seme Framework only builds the basic code for its abstract classes, making it easy to customize and extend.

- **MVC-Based**: The framework uses the Model View Controller (MVC) concept, which helps keep code organized and structured. [Read more about MVC](#).

- **Automatic Routing**: With automatic routing, you can quickly create new pages without needing extensive coding knowledge. [Learn more about URI routing](#).

- **Display Themes**: Reuse views without re-coding them with display themes. [Check out our documentation on Display Themes](#).

- **Database Query Builder**: Our database query builder class simplifies SQL preparation and reduces errors when interacting with the database. [Read more about Model Class](#).
